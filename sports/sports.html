    <h1>Pakistan Must Reconsider Babar Azam & Rizwan</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      The ongoing Asia Cup has reignited the debate about Pakistan’s team selection and its future 
      strategy in T20 cricket. While India have showcased a lineup full of attacking players, strong 
      spinners, and fast bowlers with discipline, Pakistan’s experimental approach has exposed 
      shortcomings that cannot be ignored.
    </p>

    <h2>India’s Example: Talent and Discipline</h2>
    <p>
      India entered the Asia Cup without stalwarts like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, yet their young 
      guns such as Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Tilak Varma, and Ruturaj Gaikwad stepped up. 
      They not only maintained high strike rates but also proved themselves against strong bowling 
      attacks from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Their power hitters like Rinku Singh and Sanju Samson 
      have consistently delivered under pressure. This is not luck—it’s the result of disciplined 
      training, merit-based selection, and trust in long-term performers.
    </p>

    <h2>Pakistan’s Current Struggles</h2>
    <p>
      In contrast, Pakistan’s young players such as Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, and Azam Khan have 
      only shown flashes of brilliance against weaker sides like Nepal or Afghanistan. Against stronger 
      opposition, their inconsistency becomes obvious. The team’s batting collapses highlight the 
      lack of experience and inability to rotate strike under pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>The Captaincy Dilemma</h2>
    <p>
      The current captain has been widely questioned for his T20 record. His stats do not reflect 
      the leadership or batting performance required at the highest level. Captaincy in T20 cricket 
      is not just about making field changes—it requires tactical acumen, quick decision-making, 
      and the ability to lead by example. Unfortunately, these qualities have been missing.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Babar Azam and Rizwan Are Still Vital</h2>
    <p>
      Dropping Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan at the same time has backfired. While critics argue 
      about their strike rates, their experience and ability to anchor innings cannot be dismissed. 
      Both players have proven themselves in ICC tournaments and against world-class oppositions. 
      Unlike the new faces, they have delivered in crunch matches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Babar’s consistent runs against India and Australia.</li>
      <li>Rizwan’s match-winning innings in the 2021 T20 World Cup against India.</li>
      <li>Their combined partnerships which often provided stability in otherwise fragile batting orders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning from India</h2>
    <p>
      India did not discard Kohli and Sharma. Even in transitional phases, they kept their senior 
      players around to groom the youngsters. Kohli’s experience was crucial in India’s recent T20 
      World Cup win, while Sharma’s leadership brought balance to the squad. Pakistan, on the other 
      hand, has prematurely sidelined its backbone without preparing proper replacements.
    </p>

    <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
    <p>
      Pakistan must blend experience with youth. Relying solely on untested youngsters in high-stakes 
      tournaments is a gamble that rarely pays off. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) must reconsider 
      its approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reinstate Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan in the T20 setup.</li>
      <li>Focus on merit-based selection rather than experiments.</li>
      <li>Develop young talent gradually, allowing them to learn alongside seniors.</li>
      <li>Improve fitness standards and adopt the discipline seen in India’s setup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Pakistan cricket is at a crossroads. Ignoring proven performers like Babar and Rizwan while 
      depending entirely on inexperienced players is a mistake. If Pakistan wants to compete with 
      teams like India, they must combine talent, experience, and discipline. The Asia Cup should 
      serve as a wake-up call: it’s time to bring back merit, respect seniority, and build a balanced 
      squad capable of challenging the best in the world.
