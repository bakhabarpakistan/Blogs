    <h1>Pakistan Must Reconsider Babar Azam & Rizwan in the 2025 T20 Asia Cup Team</h1>
    <p>Why the decision to leave them out undermines experience and stability</p>
  </header>

    <p>
      The Asia Cup 2025 squads were announced amid many debates, especially around the exclusions of marquee names from Pakistan’s T20 line-up. Among those left out were <strong>Babar Azam</strong> and <strong>Mohammad Rizwan</strong>, both key pillars of Pakistan’s batting order in past years. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s squad for the tournament features younger players like <strong>Saim Ayub</strong>, <strong>Mohammad Haris</strong> (keeper–batter), <strong>Hasan Nawaz</strong>, <strong>Sahibzada Farhan</strong>, <strong>Kushdil Shah</strong>, among others. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
    </p>

    <p>
      India, on the other hand, without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, also play a youthful side with players like <strong>Suryakumar Yadav</strong> (captain), <strong>Shubman Gill</strong> (vice-captain), <strong>Abhishek Sharma</strong>, <strong>Tilak Varma</strong>, <strong>Hardik Pandya</strong>, and others who have continuously delivered under pressure. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>

    <h2>Background: Pakistan & India Asia Cup 2025 Squads</h2>
    <p>
      According to full squad lists, Pakistan’s T20 squad includes: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Waseem Jr, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza, Shaheen Shah Afridi, and Sufiyan Muqeem. Notably, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan are missing. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
    </p>

    <p>
      India’s squad comprises Suryakumar Yadav (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Rinku Singh, Sanju Samson (wk). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
    </p>

    <h2>Why Babar Azam & Rizwan’s Exclusion is Concerning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experience vs. Youth:</strong> Babar and Rizwan have played numerous high-stakes matches—including Asia Cups, World Cups, and high-pressure home/away series. Their track record under pressure, against strong bowling attacks, is well-established. Excluding both simultaneously leaves a leadership vacuum.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Even when not at their absolute best, both have delivered more consistently than many newer players whose high scores come mainly against weaker opposition.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental Stability:</strong> In crunch moments, senior players generally provide stability—something younger players are yet to fully prove in Asia Cup conditions against opposition like India, Australia, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Comparing Current Young Pakistani Players</h2>
    <p>
      While players like <strong>Hasan Nawaz</strong> have impressed with strike rate (reported ~174 SR in T20s) and good performances, most of their best innings are vs lower-ranked teams. Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, and Mohammad Haris have shown glimpses of aggressive batting—but often in matches without high-pressure bowling units. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, Hasan Nawaz has done well recently, but his experience against top-tier sides is limited. Similarly, Saim Ayub has played some valuable innings, but the biggest test for him and others will be delivering against India, Australia or England in big tournaments. Without that, comparisons with Indian youngsters like Tilak Varma (who was scoring big in Indian domestic and IPL before Asia Cup) or Shubman Gill become less meaningful. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
    </p>

    <h2>India’s Extending Talent & Attack Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      India’s batting depth is showing it now. Players like Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma are given freedom to attack from ball one. Shubman Gill has shown consistency even when conditions are not easy (e.g., against seam or spin). Their recent match vs UAE in Asia Cup went smoothly for them, with bowlers like Bumrah, Kuldeep, and Varun Chakaravarthy supporting. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
    </p>

    <p>
      India’s spin attack is proactive—Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel can attack during middle overs. Their fast bowlers, too, maintain discipline. This balance gives them an edge especially when chasing or defending on tricky pitches. Meanwhile Pakistan’s spin resources, though improving, have not been as penetrative. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
    </p>

    <h2>Arguments in Favor of Reconsidering Babar & Rizwan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Veteran Anchors in Pressure Matches:</strong> In the match against India in Asia Cup 2025, Pakistan’s batting collapsed early (49–4) and recovered little, even though players like Shaheen Afridi and Sahibzada Farhan tried. With a seasoned anchor like Babar, the top order may have held firm. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership & Form:</strong> While both have had patches of slow scoring, their form overall, especially in ICC tournaments, is superior to many of the newer names. Removing them entirely risks losing that form continuity.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence & Mentorship:</strong> Young players often benefit from playing alongside senior players. Babar and Rizwan bring not just runs, but experience in pacing an innings, strategy under pressure, and handling big moments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Pakistan Should Not Compare Itself Directly to India</h2>
    <p>
      India’s talent pool is deeper; their domestic structure (IPL, state cricket) gives consistent exposure to high-pressure T20 conditions. Pakistani young players often get fewer matches against high-quality international opponents, which affects readiness. Comparing before proving is risky. India’s top order consists of players who have already proved themselves abroad, while many Pakistan youngsters are untested in those contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
    </p>

    <h2>What Pakistan Must Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-integrate Babar Azam & Mohammad Rizwan into T20 setup, at least in Asia Cup and similar tournaments, to stabilize batting.</li>
      <li>Form XI with blend: anchor (Babar/Rizwan) + 1–2 attacking youngsters (Hasan Nawaz, Saim Ayub, Farhan) to allow aggression without collapse.</li>
      <li>Use senior players in mentoring/captain roles to build resilience when the innings falls apart early.</li>
      <li>Ensure youth get exposure to good bowling: schedule matches vs stronger bowling sides in bilateral series or in leagues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The exclusion of Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan from Pakistan’s Asia Cup 2025 T20 squad marks a bold move by selectors—but it is one that carries serious risk. While young players such as Hasan Nawaz, Saim Ayub, Mohammad Haris, and Sahibzada Farhan show promise, their performances are largely yet to be tested in high-pressure conditions against elite bowling attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      India’s strategy demonstrates that aggressive batting, deep squad, and experience do not need to be mutually exclusive. Pakistan must reconsider bringing back experienced players like Babar and Rizwan—not just for runs, but for stability, mentorship, and leadership. Only then can Pakistan hope to compete consistently at the top in T20 cricket.
