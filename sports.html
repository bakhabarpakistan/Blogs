      <h2>Pakistan vs India: A Case Study of Asia Cup Teams</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on Sept 13, 2025</em></p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The rivalry between Pakistan and India in cricket is unmatched. Both teams entered the Asia Cup with young squads, missing their biggest names—Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for India, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan for Pakistan. However, the results and performances highlight contrasting approaches between the two sides.</p>

      <h3>India’s Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Power Hitting:</strong> India’s young batsmen have shown superior strike rates and confidence in finishing games.</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Indian players are more consistent in training, fitness, and execution on the field.</li>
        <li><strong>Bowling Depth:</strong> Both spin and fast bowling departments look balanced, with youngsters stepping up under pressure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pakistan’s Issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of Merit:</strong> Team selection has raised concerns. Even the captain’s stats in T20s do not justify his position.</li>
        <li><strong>No Stability:</strong> Dropping key players like Babar Azam and Rizwan was a strategic mistake. Big teams keep their match-winners.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Pakistan’s batting collapses and bowling mismanagement continue to hurt results.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Learning from India</h3>
      <p>India retained Kohli and Sharma for years, building stability. Their experience led to a World Cup victory. Pakistan, however, replaced proven players too early, weakening the squad’s foundation. This is the time Pakistan must learn and restructure based on merit rather than favoritism.</p>

      <h3>Case Study Insights</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>India invests in fitness and modern cricketing strategies.</li>
        <li>Pakistan must prioritize long-term planning over short-term experiments.</li>
        <li>Leadership should be based on performance and merit, not favoritism.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>While India continues to grow as a disciplined cricketing powerhouse, Pakistan struggles with selection issues and inconsistent performances. For Pakistan, this Asia Cup should be a wake-up call. Stability, merit-based selections, and retaining proven stars are the only ways forward.</p>
