      <h2>Case Study: Lessons from the Recent Pakistan vs India Clash</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on Sept 13, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        Cricket is more than just a sport in South Asia—it’s passion, pride, and identity. The recent Pakistan vs India match once again highlighted the striking contrast between the two teams, not just in terms of results but in terms of talent, structure, and mindset. This case study explores the key factors behind India’s rise, Pakistan’s struggles, and what needs to change if Pakistan wants to return to its glory days.
      </p>

      <h3>India’s Strengths: Talent, Depth, and Strategy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Power Hitting:</strong> India has built a solid pool of players who can hit consistently, whether it’s Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, or Hardik Pandya. Their ability to rotate strike and clear boundaries under pressure has become a hallmark.</li>
        <li><strong>Spin Department:</strong> With spinners like Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel, India has control in the middle overs. They take wickets while keeping the run rate in check.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Bowling:</strong> Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj have given India a world-class pace attack. They combine raw pace with deadly accuracy, something Pakistan’s bowlers struggle with consistently.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Balance:</strong> India has invested in bench strength. Even when star players are unavailable, replacements step in without lowering standards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pakistan’s Struggles: Selection and Merit Issues</h3>
      <p>
        In contrast, Pakistan continues to grapple with issues of selection and merit. The biggest example is the captaincy. The current captain’s T20 stats do not justify his place, let alone leadership. Instead of building a team around performers, management seems to rely on favoritism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exclusion of experienced match-winners like Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan further weakened the team. No successful cricketing nation sidelines its backbone players in the middle of major tournaments. For instance, India trusted Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma despite criticism, and they ended up delivering a World Cup. Pakistan, unfortunately, did the opposite.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Issues with Pakistan’s Approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of Merit:</strong> Players are often selected based on favoritism, not consistent domestic or international performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Planning:</strong> Constant chopping and changing of the squad prevent players from settling into roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership Crisis:</strong> Captains are chosen without leadership qualities or proven performance under pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Neglecting Senior Players:</strong> Unlike other teams, Pakistan sidelines senior cricketers instead of nurturing them as mentors.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lessons from India</h3>
      <p>
        Pakistan can learn valuable lessons from India’s cricketing model:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Back your top players in big tournaments. Trust and stability build confidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Domestic Development:</strong> Strengthen domestic cricket to produce quality replacements.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness & Discipline:</strong> India’s strict fitness standards keep players in peak shape—Pakistan must adopt the same.</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> A captain should be the best performer, not just a convenient choice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Pakistan cricket is at a crossroads. The talent is there, but poor management, favoritism, and lack of merit-based decisions are holding the team back. The recent clash with India was not just a defeat—it was a reality check. If Pakistan wants to compete at the highest level, they must rebuild with honesty, consistency, and a focus on merit. Otherwise, they will keep repeating the same mistakes while rivals like India move further ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time to act is now. Pakistan must stop repeating errors, respect its match-winners, and build a system that rewards performance. Only then can the Men in Green rise again to the glory their fans desperately crave.
